- [[Abstract]]
	- Fuel consumption models have been widely used to predict fuel consumption and evaluate new vehicle technologies. However, due to the uncertainty and high nonlinearity of fuel systems, it is difficult to develop an accurate fuel consumption model for real-time calculations. Additionally, whether the developed fuel consumption models are suitable for eco-routing and eco-driving systems is unknown. To address these issues, a systematic review of fuel consumption models and the factors that influence fuel economy is presented. First, the primary factors that affect fuel economy, including travel-related, weather-related, vehicle-related, roadway-related, traffic-related, and driver-related factors, are discussed. Then, state-of-the-art fuel consumption models developed after 2000 are summarized and classified into three broad types based on transparency, i.e., white-box, grey-box and black-box models. Consequently, the limitations and potential possibilities of fuel consumption modelling are highlighted in this review.
