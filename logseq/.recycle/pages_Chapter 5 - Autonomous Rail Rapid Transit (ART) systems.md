- [[Abstract]]
	- This chapter first introduces the hardware of the Autonomous rail Rapid Transit (ART), which can be divided into two parts: the basic components of railway vehicles and various sensors based on ART. Then, technologies of ART are introduced, including road traffic interaction, navigation, communication, and scheduling management. Finally, pedestrian detection algorithms are introduced in detail, including the traditional pedestrian detection algorithm and pedestrian detection algorithm based on deep learning. According to the characteristics of ART, a feasible pedestrian attitude prediction algorithm is described in the following aspects, including keyframe extraction, pedestrian contour extraction, pedestrian attitude-behavior modeling, and feature parameter extraction. The prediction algorithm helps to understand ART intelligent pedestrian detection.
