- [[Abstract]]
	- Fuel oil leaked onto asphalt pavement will damage the asphalt layer by dissolving the binder, softening the mixture and finally resulting in distress such as raveling and pitting. In the meantime, the skid resistance, high temperature stability and water stability deteriorate dramatically. Silicone resin is a fog sealing material for asphalt pavement. It forms a three-dimensional network structure with -Si-O- chains and therefore shows strong hydrophobicity and chemical stability. This paper looks into the effect of silicone resin on the fuel oil corrosion resistance of asphalt mixture. The contact angle, Cantabro test, water stability test, wheel tracking test and three-point bending test were used to investigate the road performance and the corrosion resistance under diesel and gasoline. It was found that, compared with diesel, the contact angle between gasoline and asphalt is smaller, indicating better compatibility. The gasoline corrosion decreases the properties of asphalt mixture more than that of diesel, which indicates that the compatibility is related to the corrosion effect. The results also show that silicone resin can effectively improve the adhesion, strength, water stability and high- and low-temperature performance of asphalt mixture before and after fuel oil erosion, and the improving effect on asphalt mixture after oil erosion is better.
