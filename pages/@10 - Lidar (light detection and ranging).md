- [[Abstract]]
	- Abstract: Lidar is an acronym for light detection and ranging, similar to that for radar (radio detection and ranging), and uses a narrow laser beam as a probe of the surrounding environment, including 3D mapping of distant hard targets and spectroscopic sensing of gases and constituents from afar. This chapter covers an overview of lidar principals, laser beam transmission through the atmosphere, the lidar equation, different types of lidar systems, and brief examples of lidar measurements including detection of atmospheric gases, 3D mapping of terrain, remote wind measurements, and emission-based laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy of distant surfaces.
