- # Science
	- I don't fault the atoms for wanting to bond. I fault the electrons for thinking they're too noble to share.
- # Computer Science
	- I don't blame the data for wanting to compress. I blame the algorithm for thinking it's too optimal to lose quality.
	- I don't fault the bits for wanting to flip. I fault the parity for thinking it's too reliable to detect errors.
- # Civil Engineer
	- I don't blame the bricks for wanting to stack. I blame the mortar for thinking it's too strong to crack.
