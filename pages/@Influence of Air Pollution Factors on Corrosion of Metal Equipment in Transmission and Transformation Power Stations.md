- [[Abstract]]
	- In this paper, the atmospheric environmental corrosion grade of substations in 11 prefecture level cities in Shanxi Province is evaluated through a metal hanging sheet experiment. Combined with the main environmental factors, such as temperature, relative humidity, and the concentration of main pollution factors, such as SO2, Clâˆ’, dust, etc., the influence of various factors on the corrosion of transmission and transformation equipment is analyzed, and the corresponding anti-corrosion measures are put forward.
