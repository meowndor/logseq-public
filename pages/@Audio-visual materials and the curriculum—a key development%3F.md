- [[Abstract]]
	- Educational technology, with its highly structured use of carefully prepared learning materials, has been around now for 40 years. In that time, millions of pounds have been poured into it in a worldwide effort to improve the quality of teaching and the efficiency of learning. While the technical quality of what is now available is undeniably improved, its impact has been less than radical. Will the possession of expensive hardware, proliferative software, and reasonably well-trained support professionals have any. marked effect on schools of nursing? The answer—in the short term—is probably no. Given the small proportion of time students spend in school, it is unreasonable to expect qualitative results. But in the long term it is quite possible that an emphasis on these issues will quickly uncover more basic questions—curricular questions which could have far-reaching effects on nurse training. And as we move through the 80s, faced with the computer revolution, where a low-priced pocket computer game contains the entire primary mathematics syllabus—what price the syllabus of nurse training? The hope is that the coming decade will offer better, more flexible vehicles for training—but the suggestion is that to make the most productive use of developments, some degree of standardisation is necessary. Whether the nursing profession can move away from the NIH (‘not invented here’) syndrome to embrace the possibilities of the 80s remains to be seen.
