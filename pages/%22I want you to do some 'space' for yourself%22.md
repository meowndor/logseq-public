- Sometimes, when people say they need "space", it can be confusing or even hurtful to the other person. But the truth is, everyone needs their own kind of space.
- ## For me, the time I spend with those I care about is my space.
- I cherish those moments, and they bring me the peace and contentment that others might find in solitude. So, while I may not need the same kind of space as you, I still need that special time to connect with those who matter most to me.
