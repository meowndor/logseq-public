- # What Makes Deep Frying Food Bad?
- Deep frying food can be unhealthy for several reasons. When foods are fried in oil, they lose water and absorb fat, which increases their calorie content [^1]. This can lead to weight gain and obesity if consumed in excess. Fried foods are also typically high in trans fats, which are associated with an increased risk of many diseases, including heart disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity [^2](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/why-fried-foods-are-bad).
- ## Weight gain and obesity can have many symptoms beyond just an increase in body size
- Some common symptoms of obesity include shortness of breath, sweating more than usual, snoring, trouble sleeping, skin problems from moisture accumulating in the folds, fatigue, and pain in the back and joint[^3]
